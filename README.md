# About the files : Each file paves the way to build the model for the simulator

## Behavioral Cloning contains
  * "model.h5" which is the trained model
  * "Drive.py" python script to link the model with the Udacity simulator

## Data contains
  * Images captured during the training session from the simulator

## Convolution Neural Networks
  * -- predicts the digit from its model trained with a MNIST data

## Decision-contour
  * -- plots the contour boundary based on the probabilities defined by our decision boundary

## Deep Neural Networks
  * --  a classification based model that predicts the
  vicinity of the given point

## MNIST
  * -- a MNIST data set used for the DNN with 'relu' as activation function

## Multi-class Neural Network
  * -- a Multiclass neural network that uses 'categorical entropy'

## Perceptron
  * -- a simple perceptron model that'll be later used in the simulation model
